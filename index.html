    <h3>Timeline of GWC's Amazing Life</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>1860's</strong> - GWC was born into slavery in missouri. He
        didn't know his own birthday, only that it was sometime just before 1865
        when slavery was abolished. His parents were purchased for $700
      </li>
      <br />
      <li id="tribute-info">
        <strong>One Week Old</strong> - GWC, his sister and mother were
        kidnapped or "stolen". George was eventually recovered by his "owner"
        Moses Carver, and returned to him and was reunited with his brother. His
        mother and sister were not recovered :( .

      <br />
      <li>
        <strong>Childhood</strong> - GWC was taught how to read and write by his
        "Aunt". He identified himself as "Carver's George"
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <strong>Still a youngin</strong> - GWC tried to go to a school for black
        children that was 10 miles away, he slept in a barn and eventually
        rented a room from a woman named Mariah Watkins who said he should call
        himself "George Carver" and encouraged him to spread the knowledge he
        would earn.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <strong>Teen</strong> - George moved around from family to family, often
        afraid for his life. Eventually he got his diploma from Minneapolis
        Kansas ( Not the place in minnesota )
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <strong>Young adulthood</strong> - George applied and was accepted to
        university in kansas. When he got there they said he actually couldn't
        attend because he was black
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <strong>Early 20's</strong> - George Homesteaded a small parcel of land.
        He busted his ass on 17 acres and began farming and doing odd jobs,
        eventually he secured a 300$ educational loan
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <strong>Student George</strong> - GWC started out studying art and
        piano, eventually he changed gears and studied botany, his research
        about plant pathology gained recognition and
        <bold>he was the first black faculty member at Iowa State!</bold>
      </li>
      <br />

        <strong>Proffesor George</strong> - He became the head of the
        Agriculture at Tuskegee University where he taught for 47 years
      </li>
      <br />
      <h4>Cool Shit GWC Did</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Made a Traveling Classroom built out of a wagon to teach poor folks
          remotely
        </li>
        <li>
          Learned how to make Crappy farmland into awesome farmland, through
          crop rotation and other methods
        </li>
        <li>
          He knew alot about sweet potatoes and peanuts and made inventions from
          them
        </li>
        <li>
          George worked to promote racial harmony, although eventually wealthy,
          he taught mostly for free and didn't earn a fraction of his potential
        </li>
        <li>
          GWC's acheivements and knowledge improved the quality of life and
          standing for many poor people
        </li>
        <li>Dude was the Stehphen Hawking of Farming</li>
      </ul>
    </ol>
    <br />
    <div>
    <h4>Something I felt like I could relate to ( and didn't know )</h4>
    <p>
      GWC thought Science and Jesus weren't opponents but friends. You can't
      have one without the other. He also believed that through God we could
      destroy racial barriers
    </p>
    <img id="image-two" src="./resources/bro.jpg" />
    <br />
    <p>He gave this advice to his students</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Be clean both inside and out.</li>
      <li>Neither look up to the rich nor down on the poor.</li>
      <li>Lose, if need be, without squealing.</li>
      <li>Win without bragging</li>
      <li>Always be considerate of women, children, and older people.</li>
      <li>Be too brave to lie</li>
      <li>Be too generous to cheat</li>
      <li>Take your share of the world and let others take theirs</li>
    </ul>
    <p>And boy did he live by those principles</p>

    <h4>In summary</h4>

    <p>
      GWC was an amazing guy who came up in an awful envrionment. He still made
      it. He gave it all away. He was a pioneer in science and showed us all how
      to be kind and generous despite being treated like the dirt he chose to
      study, and taught people to turn into wealth. Rock on George.

      <h4>GWC Quotes</h4>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Education is the key to unlock the golden door of freedom.</p>

        <p>
          Fear of something is at the root of hate for others, and hate within
          will eventually destroy the hater.
        </p>

        <p>
          I love to think of nature as an unlimited broadcasting station,
          through which God speaks to us every hour, if we will only tune in.
        </p>

        <p>
          There is no short cut to achievement. Life requires thorough
          preparation - veneer isn't worth anything.
